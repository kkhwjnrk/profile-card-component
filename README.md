# Profile Card Component 📄💻

This project is my submission for the Frontend Mentor Profile Card Components challenge, in which I was assigned to create a profile card. I made it responsive using HTML and Sass. I'm taking a mobile-first approach to ensure a responsive design across multiple screen sizes.

### Design 🎨

The profile card component showcases a background image and a content section that displays the user's profile image, name, age, and location. The component also includes a social statistics section showcasing the user's follower count, number of likes, and photos. For an example, please visit the [Mobile](./design/mobile-design.jpg) and [Desktop design](./design/desktop-design.jpg).

### Technologies Used 💻
